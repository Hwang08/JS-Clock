# JS-Clock

NOT FINISHED!!! I HAVE TO MODIFY THE CSS.

Momentom is a clone of the google chrome browser extension [Momentum](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca?hl=en).

Uses [Open Weather Map API](openweathermap.org/api) to show weather based on your geo location.

To Do List is dynamically created, saved and deleted from the local storage of the user.

Clock format - Hours:Minutes:Seconds.

Gives a random background every time the site is visited or refreshed.
